However, it also includes an additional check `(int(x) == x and int(y) == y and int(z) == z)`, which is redundant because `isinstance()` already verifies if the numbers are integers.\n\n2. **Equality Check**: The code snippet uses `int(x+y) == z` to check if one number is equal to the sum of the other two.

Additionally, the code should handle cases where the numbers are not integers properly, as the reference solution does.\n\nHere's a corrected version of the code snippet that addresses these issues:\n\n```python\ndef any_int(x, y, z):\n    if isinstance(x, int) and isinstance(y, int) and isinstance(z, int):\n        return (x + y == z) or (x + z == y) or (y + z == x)\n    return False\n```\n\nThis version removes the redundant check for integer type and ensures that the function behaves correctly even if the numbers are not integers.",

Therefore, the overall time complexity is \\(O(n \\log k)\\).\n   - **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \\(O(k)\\) because the heap stores at most `k` elements.\n   - **Logic**:\n     - The code initializes a min-heap with the first `k` elements of the array.\n     - For each subsequent element in the array, it checks if the current element is greater than the smallest element in the heap (which is the root of the heap).\n     - If the current element is larger, it removes the smallest element from the heap and adds the current element, ensuring the heap always contains the `k` largest elements.\n     - Finally, it returns the negative of the elements in the heap, as the heap stores the smallest elements as negative values to simulate a max-heap.\n\n3. **Conclusion**:\n   - The code snippet does not fully cover the required functionalities.
