The input string is separated by spaces, and each group is a sequence of parentheses.\n\nThe given code snippet is a starting point for the solution, but it does not implement the required functionality. The function is defined, but it does not contain any logic to parse the input string and calculate the deepest level of nesting for each group.\n\nTo address this problem, the code needs to be modified to iterate over the input string, count the opening and closing parentheses, and keep track of the current level of nesting. When a closing parenthesis is encountered, the level of nesting should be decremented. When an opening parenthesis is encountered, the level of nesting should be incremented. The deepest level of nesting for each group can be calculated by keeping track of the maximum level of nesting encountered during the iteration.\n\nHere is a possible implementation:\n```\ndef parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:\n    result = []\n    current_level = 0\n    max_level = 0\n    for char in paren_string:\n        if char == '(':\n            current_level += 1\n            max_level = max(max_level, current_level)\n        elif char == ')':\n            current_level -= 1\n    result.append(max_level)\n    return result\n```\nThis implementation initializes an empty list `result` to store the deepest level of nesting for each group, and two variables `current_level` and `max_level` to keep track of the current and maximum level of nesting, respectively. It then iterates over the input string, incrementing `current_level` when an opening parenthesis is encountered and decrementing it when a closing parenthesis is encountered. The maximum level of nesting is updated whenever a new maximum is encountered. Finally, the deepest level of nesting for each group is appended to the `result` list and returned.",
