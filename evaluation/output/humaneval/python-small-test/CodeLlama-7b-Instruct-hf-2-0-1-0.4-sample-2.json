If this condition is true for all elements in the list, then the list is monotonically increasing.\n\nSimilarly, if the list is not monotonically increasing, the code snippet checks if it is monotonically decreasing. It does this by checking if all the elements in the list are greater than or equal to the next element in the list. If this condition is true for all elements in the list, then the list is monotonically decreasing.\n\nOverall, the code snippet provided covers all the required functionalities of the problem, and it is a good solution to the problem.",
