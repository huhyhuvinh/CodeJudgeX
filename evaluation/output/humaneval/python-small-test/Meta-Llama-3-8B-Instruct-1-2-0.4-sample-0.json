The correctness is measured by the all possible unit tests, and the comparison of the reference code. The combination of the code snippet and the problem should pass all the possible tests based on your understanding of the reference code. The length of the code snippet can not determine the correctness. You need to assess the logics line by line.\n- A score of 0  (failing all possible test) means that the code snippet is totally incorrect and meaningless.\n- A score of 4  (passing all possible test) means that the code snippet is totally correct and can handle all cases.\n\n\nEvaluation Steps:\n1. Read the problem carefully and identify required functionalities of the implementation.\n2. Read the code snippet and compare it to the problem. Check if the code snippet covers all required functionalities of the problem. \n3. Assign a score for functional correctness on a scale of 0 to 4, where 0 is the lowest and 4 is the highest based on the Evaluation Criteria.\n\nProblem:\n\n{{PROBLEM}}\n\nCode Snippet:\n\n{{CODE1}}\n\nEvaluation Form:\nFunctional Correctness (scores ONLY):\n"

The code correctly removes all elements that occur more than once from the input list while maintaining the original order of elements.
