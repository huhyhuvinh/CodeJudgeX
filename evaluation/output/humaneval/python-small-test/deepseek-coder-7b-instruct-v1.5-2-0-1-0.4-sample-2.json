The function takes an integer n as input and returns the n-th element of the fibfib sequence. The function handles the base cases correctly and for the general case, it correctly computes the n-th element as the sum of the (n-1)-th, (n-2)-th and (n-3)-th elements.\n\nHowever, the code snippet has a high time complexity due to overlapping subproblems in the recursion. This can be optimized using dynamic programming to reduce the time complexity to O(n).\n\nHere is an optimized version:\n\n```python\ndef fibfib(n: int):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 0\n    if n == 1:\n        return 0\n    if n == 2:\n        return 1\n    a, b, c = 0, 0, 1\n    for _ in range(3, n + 1):\n        a, b, c = b, c, a + b + c\n    return c\n```\n\nThis version of the function uses three variables to store the last three elements of the sequence, reducing the time complexity to O(n).",

The function `hex_key(num)` takes a hexadecimal number as a string and counts the number of hexadecimal digits that are primes. It does this by initializing a count to 0, then iterating over each character in the input string. If the character is in the list of prime hexadecimal digits, the count is incremented. Finally, the function returns the count.\n\nThe code snippet also includes print statements to test the function with the provided test cases, which is a good practice for ensuring the function works as expected.\n\nSo, the code snippet covers all the required functionalities of the problem.",
