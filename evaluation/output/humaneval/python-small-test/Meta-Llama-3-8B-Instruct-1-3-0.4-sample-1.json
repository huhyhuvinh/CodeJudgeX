The correctness is measured by the all possible unit tests, and the comparison of the reference code. The combination of the code snippet and the problem should pass all the possible tests based on your understanding of the reference code. The length of the code snippet can not determine the correctness. You need to assess the logics line by line.\n- A score of 0  (failing all possible test) means that the code snippet is totally incorrect and meaningless.\n- A score of 4  (passing all possible test) means that the code snippet is totally correct and can handle all cases.\n\n\nEvaluation Steps:\n1. Read the problem carefully and identify required functionalities of the implementation.\n2. Read the code snippet and compare it to the reference code. Check if the code snippet covers all required functionalities of the problem, and if it is as good as the reference code. \n3. Assign a score for functional correctness on a scale of 0 to 4, where 0 is the lowest and 4 is the highest based on the Evaluation Criteria.\n\nProblem:\n\n{{PROBLEM}}\n\nReference Code:\n\n{{CODE2}}\n\nCode Snippet:\n{{CODE1}}\n\nEvaluation Form:\nFunctional Correctness (scores ONLY):\n"

It does not calculate the minimum number of times the bucket needs to be lowered.\n\nThe code snippet is trying to calculate the number of times the bucket needs to be lowered by counting the number of wells that are empty, not empty, full, partially full, and partially empty. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not take into account the capacity of the bucket and the amount of water in each well.\n\nA correct implementation would need to calculate the maximum amount of water that can be extracted from each well using the bucket, and then calculate the minimum number of times the bucket needs to be lowered to empty all the wells.\n\nBased on the evaluation criteria, I would give the code snippet a score of 0 out of 4 for functional correctness."
